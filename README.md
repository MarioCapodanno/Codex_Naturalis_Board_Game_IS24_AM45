## DOCUMENTATION

### UML

UML diagrams for the entire project, including all classes, as well as separate uml diagrams for the model, controller, network, enumeration, and view components, are available in the `documents/uml` folder.


### How to use JARs 

We create it with Maven Shade Plugin  
For server     ``` java -jar AM45-1.0-SNAPSHOT-server.jar [-ip <ipAddressr>] [-pRMI <numberPort>] [-pTCP <numberPort>] ```  
For a client  ``` java -jar AM45-1.0-SNAPSHOT-client.jar [-cli] [-gui] [-tcp] [-rmi] ```  


### JavaDoc

The following documentation includes a description for most of the classes and methods used, follows the Java
documentation techniques, and can be accessed by generating it from code or
here the folder `Documents/javadoc`.  
Starts from index.html.
